# WORKOUT-GENERATOR
- This application generates a strength training plan based on the users chosen training frequency (2x 3x or 4x a week)
- Based on the training frequency, the user will be asked to choose a few different exercises
- The user will be asked to input their 1RM for their chosen exercises (which will then calculate the 1RM) based on the given rep range (3~6reps)
- The program will then generate the users program for the next 6 weeks
